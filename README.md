# Distributed_Learning_for_Automatic_Modulation_Recognition

This repository presents two distributed methods for Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR). These methods include consensus voting (DAMR-V) and feature sharing (DAMR-F) approaches as detailed in the following article. Please use the following paper for citation:

In this study, we utilized the TeMuRAMRD.2023 (Terrain-driven Multi-Receiver Automatic Modulation Recognition Dataset) as a multi-receiver dataset.
